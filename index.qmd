I'm a M.Sc. in Data Science and B.Sc. in Finance working a full-time job as a Senior Data Scientist at GBM. My research interests include applications of data science processes and machine learning in finance. I work in the Data Science & Strategy team and develop novel data mining methods to extract actionable investment ideas.

# Prework

The workshop will also cover the basic logic of ggplot2 and its components. However, some pre-knowledge on how the package works is beneficial for following the examples and for the group exercises. A good overview is provided might by the "First Steps" chapter of the ggplot2 book by Hadley Wickham et al.: [ggplot2-book.org/getting-started.html](https://ggplot2-book.org/getting-started.html)

The example codes and the hands-on workshop parts are run in the RStudio cloud. Thus, nothing but a laptop is needed.

If you want to run the workshop content locally on your machine, please make sure to install a suitable IDE (RStudio, VS Code or others), a recent version of R (4.1+) and the following packages and typefaces.

*For Mac OS users:*\
Please make sure that [XQuartz is installed](https://www.xquartz.org/) which is needed to use the cairo pdf device.

## Required Packages

-   **tidyverse packages and friends**
    -   ggplot2, readr, tibble, dplyr, tidyr, forcats, stringr, lubridate, here, systemfonts, scales
-   **extension packages**
    -   ggrepel, ggforce, ggtext, ggdist, ggbeeswarm, gghalves, ggblur, patchwork
-   **color packages**
    -   viridis, RColorBrewer, rcartocolor, scico, ggsci, ggthemes, nord, MetBrewer, colorspace, colorblindr
-   **util packages**
    -   magick, grid, grDevices
-   **data packages**
    -   palmerpenguins, rnaturalearth
-   **financial packages**
    -   yfR, tidyquant

Run this code to install the packages if needed:

```         
packages <- c(
  "ggplot2", "readr", "tibble", "tidyr", "forcats", "stringr",
  "lubridate", "here", "systemfonts", "magick", "scales", "grid",
  "grDevices", "colorspace", "viridis", "RColorBrewer", "rcartocolor",
  "scico", "ggsci", "ggthemes", "nord", "MetBrewer", "ggrepel",
  "ggforce", "ggtext", "ggdist", "ggbeeswarm", "gghalves", "patchwork", 
  "palmerpenguins", "rnaturalearth", "sf", "rmapshaper", "devtools"
)

install.packages(setdiff(packages, rownames(installed.packages())))  

---- install {colorblindr} and requirements ----
remotes::install_github("wilkelab/cowplot")
remotes::install_github("clauswilke/colorblindr")
```

## Required Typefaces

We will make use of custom fonts. A lot.\
If you want to follow all contents locally, make sure the following typefaces are installed:

-   Roboto Condensed: <a href='www.fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Condensed' target="_blank">fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Condensed</a>
-   Cabinet Grotesk: <a href='www.fontshare.com/fonts/cabinet-grotesk' target="_blank">fontshare.com/fonts/cabinet-grotesk</a>
-   Tabular: <a href='www.fontshare.com/fonts/tabular' target="_blank">fontshare.com/fonts/tabular</a>
-   Boska: <a href='(www.fontshare.com/fonts/boska' target="_blank">fontshare.com/fonts/boska</a>
-   Pally: <a href='www.fontshare.com/fonts/pally' target="_blank">fontshare.com/fonts/pally</a>

You can download all typefaces as a single zip file [here](ggplot2-course-fonts.zip).
