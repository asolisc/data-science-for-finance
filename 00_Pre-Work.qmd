## About this course

The course will run for 6 weekends.

-   Combines slides, live coding examples, quiz questions, and exercises for you to participate in.
-   You will need to install the software used throughout the course.
-   Software consists of:
    -   **Programming Language Core**: R
    -   **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: RStudio
    -   **R extensions**: Packages (or libraries)

## What is R?

R is a programming language and free software environment for data science, statistical computing, and graphics.

R was concieved in 1992 by **Ross Ihaka** and **Robert Gentleman** as an open source (that is, the original source code is made freely available) implementation of the S programming language.

Since its release in 1995, R has outgrown its original purpose and is now used to:

-   run statistical analysis and data workflows
